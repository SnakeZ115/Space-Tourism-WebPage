## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Gulp
- Npm

### What I learned

In the web course I am taking right now I worked with SCSS and gulp and I wanted to use those technologies in a FrontEnd Mentor Challenge and this was a perfect one. I learned a lot about SCSS and Gulp. I like those technologies because I had my files more organized, for example, the layout folder is for components (thing that I am gonna use more than once)  and the pages folder is for the SCSS of each page. Something that I saw while working in this project is that it is so much easier to work if you have the figma files because you can see all the exact styles.

### Continued development

While I take the web course, I am going to try to practice the skills I'm learning in more FrontEnd Mentor Challenges.
